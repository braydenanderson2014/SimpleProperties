KNOWN ISSUES:

* Underlying Library Hashtable has 2 known issues at this time. 1 issue is confirmed to be causing issues with Properties -> get() returns nullptr and getElement() returns Nothing even if there should be
an element associated with the key given to those functions... String* value = table.get("key1"); or String value = table.getElement("key1");  Because of this, Properties might warn you that an element does not exist
even if it should.
